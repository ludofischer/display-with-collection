A React component that manages a collection of items for your render props.

This was born as an experiment to see how deep you could go with separating building blocks
for basic UI into separate render-props based wrapper.

It all started with a way to manage notifications. But if you extract the logic to display the UI,
you end up with a React wrapper for basic collection operations: add and remove. Useful?
